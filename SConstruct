"""
To make this SConscript work, I have removed all 'src' in includes in the 'src' folder of gtest.
Note, that just unzipping gtest will leave you with the files in read-only mode. To change
this, do the following in the source folder of gtest:
chmod +w *
As well I rename or link the gtest-Blah folder to just gtest (or symlink or whatever similar you like).
